Libraries used for following developments:

API - Flask, Bottle, Pyramid
Website - Django, TurboGears, web2py
APP(CMS, ERP) - Plone, django-cms, Mezzanine

To run flask app, open powershell and execute below commands:
$env:FLASK_APP = "service.py"
flask run

C:\Python36\python.exe 

Application Scripting : Include new users flow or UI or functionality to integrate with existing Application. For Demo will use Blender and interact using Application script.

The Basics : Python.org have loads of resources about python.
Working with python:
1.	python
	-Executing python file
	-Rudimentary REPL : Read, Eval, Print, Loop : Used for checking python libraries.

2.	pip : pip install packager : used to install 3rd party libraries.

3.	ipython : Same as Rudimentary REPL but interactive Shell and much more.

Resources : docs.python.org: official pyhton documents

pip - is used for the following:
1.	Install
2.	Uninstall
3.	Dependencies - to install dependencies.
4.	Package group
5.	Versions

pypi.python.org - is a place where all the packages are present to be used.

Python2 is used over python3 only if - No control over environment or Libraries not supported python3

Executing Python Code:
1.	Interpreter - Executing python file using python.exe
2.	REPL - Call out to python code within Interactive REPL.
3.	Natively - Compile and run (py2exe, pyinstaller etc.)

In case of any changes to py file we need to reload the library:
import importlib
importlib.reload(hello_world)

For Autoload use ipyhton:
1.	%load_ext autoreload
2.	%autoreload 2
3.	from hello_world import sayHello
4.	sayHello()
